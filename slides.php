                    <h2>Drop Zone</h2>
                    <p>Well, what can I say about this coaster? It is absolutely awesome. Smooth with lots of airtime. That drop is breathtaking.One of the best things about this ride is the hourly capacity. The line was moving quickly when I rode this beast and was able to get in the line and ride it an additional four more times. (thrillnetwork.com)</p>
